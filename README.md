# MapViewer

## MapViewer dependencies :

1. Visual C++ 14 (from Visual Studio 2015)

2. Qt 5.7 for VS2015 32 bit (http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.7/5.7.1/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015-5.7.1.exe.mirrorlist).

3. OpenCV 2.4.x 

4. Qt Creator (which should be already packaged with  Qt 5.7 for VS2015 32 bit)

Note: this is my configuration currently under Windows. Adaption for other platforms should be easy. OpenCV 2.4.x should be built from source by yourself for VC14 (binary version is only for VC12 i.e. Visual Studio 2013).



## MapViewer usage:

1. open MapViewer.exe.

2. click on 'Open Map File' button.

3. choose sample map file 'odoslam.map' to open and view the map.

4. scroll the mouse wheel to zoom; drag with left mouse button to rotate; drag with right mouse button to translate.
